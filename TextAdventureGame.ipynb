    "    It consists of three stages, as well as, defined functions \n",
    "    to start, win and lose.\n",
    "    The player, Marty Mcfly, travels back to 1955 and needs to\n",
    "    make some decisions in a way to not change the present.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Round 1: Prevent the father to be or not being hit by the car.\n",
    "    Round 2: Father meets or not the mother.\n",
    "    Round 3: The stranger asks questions about the doctor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The game ends either in success, the presents remain unchanged,\n",
